          We are a multi-faceted team with various backgrounds that came
          together around an idea we believe will revolutionize the way people
          shop for larger purchases that are typically negotiated. <br /> <br />
          The idea started with an issue we have all faced, purchasing a new car
          and the anxiety faced with negotiating a deal. After a few weeks of
          brainstorming, we came up with the idea of creating a platform that
          would be mutually beneficial to the consumer and the seller.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          {" "}
          We have created a way for consumers to save money by having
          dealerships compete for business, without the harassing emails and
          phone calls.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          {" "}
          For the dealerships, we generate quality leads of local individuals
          looking to purchase a vehicle. Dealerships will be able to interact
          with consumers through an app and bring their sales platform into the
          21st century.
